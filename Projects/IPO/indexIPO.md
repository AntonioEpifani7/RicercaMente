# INTRODUCTION
What's that?
We've created an open source paper where anyone, including you, can contribute. 

Predicting the success or failure of an IPO using machine learning, is it possible?
We will start by analyzing the most important papers in the field, doing a literature review. 
Then, we will be the ones trying our hand at this endeavor and analyzing the results. 
If you want to help, you can contribute by improving each section of the paper. 

An initial public offering (IPO) is the process through which a private company becomes publicly traded by offering shares of its stock to the general public for the first time. This is typically done to raise capital for expansion, pay off debts, or provide liquidity to existing shareholders. 

During an IPO, the company works with investment banks to determine the offering price for its shares. This price is often determined through a process of valuation, which considers factors such as the company's financial performance, growth prospects, industry comparables, and market conditions. 

In this research, we will seek to understand the success or failure of an IPO in the short term.
By success, we mean if the stock price significantly increases immediately after the IPO and remains stable or continues to rise in the subsequent period, it can be considered a success. Conversely, if the stock price decreases or remains below the offering price for an extended period, it might be considered a failure. 

However, remember, it is in the long term that the quality of a company is truly seen.
